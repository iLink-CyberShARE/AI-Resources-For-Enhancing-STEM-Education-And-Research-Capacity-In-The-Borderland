# AI Resources for Enhancing STEM Education and Research

This GitHub repository is designed to enhance exposure to Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on Machine Learning, within traditional STEM education. It is also intended for researchers seeking to apply AI techniques in their projects. To support this goal, a series of Google Colab Notebooks have been developed to showcase widely used AI methods and modeling approaches, using third-party, real-world, publicly available datasets. These resources are intended to be hands-on and adaptable, enabling educators, students and researchers to explore AI concepts through practical, inquiry driven activities. These materials promote experiential learning, helping users connect theory to application while building foundational skills in data analysis, modeling, and fair AI use.

# Google Colab Notebooks Overview
This repository includes several **Google Colab Notebooks** covering a range of AI topics and applications. 

**Topics Covered**
  - Computer Vision:
    Using remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) to predict an environmental variable (Solar Radiation).
  - Classification:
    Applying classification techniques to the UCI Mushroom Dataset to identify edible or poisonous mushrooms.
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP):
    Implementing word embeddings and a sentiment analysis example to explore text-based AI applications.

**Models**
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Decision Trees and
  - T-SNE Cluster analysis.

**Model Statistics and Analysis:**   
+ Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP):
  Implemented for the **Computer Vision** notebook to provide interpretability and insight into model predictions.
