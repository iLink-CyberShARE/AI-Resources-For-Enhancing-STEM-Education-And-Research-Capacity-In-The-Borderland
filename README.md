# AI Resources For Enhancing STEM Education And Research Capacity In The Borderland Region

This GitHub repository aims to further disseminate AI knowledge in the border region. For this purpose, several Colab Notebooks were created on several different topics. 
  - Computer Vision using remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine (GEE).
  - Classification using the UCI mushroom dataset. 
  - Natural Language by implementing word embeddings and a sentiment analysis example. 

**Models**
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Decision Trees and T-SNE Cluster analysis.

**Model Statistics and Analysis:**   
+ Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were implemented for the computer vision topic.

# How to Run

All code is made available as a Python notebook that can be executed online with Google Colab.       

To run from scratch:   
1. Open the Link notebook.
2. To execute the notebook, go to Runtime->Run all. Each code section can also be executed individually.
